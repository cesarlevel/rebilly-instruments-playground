### Configuration
The application uses [environment variables](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html#modes) on the server component

The environment variables are loaded from the file `.env` (Git-ignored).

Below is an example of how to config the environment variables, copy them into `.env`

```dotenv
VITE_P_KEY={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
VITE_ORG_ID={ORGANIZATION_ID}
```
